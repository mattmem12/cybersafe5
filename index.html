    <h1>A Trojan Horse is a software that appears
to be helpful or legitimate. When in reality
it is harmful code that damages or steals
information. Trojan Horse malware tricks
a user into downloading it by imitating a
reliable web service that a user would
find helpful. A common example of a
Trojan Horse is a pop up of an anti
malware software that will prevent your
computer from being hacked when
downloaded but in reality you are
downloading a hack. Once a Trojan is
downloaded and looks for financial
information, encrypts files, and hijack
your device to take down other devices.</h1>
